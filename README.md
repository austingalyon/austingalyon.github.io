# Welcome to my GitHub Page

This aim of this site is to be an easily accessible and updateable page to link to any presentation materials I have or any cool stuff I build if I ever get around to it.  
My intent is to eventually switch over to a fully custom/hosted site but knowing me that probably won't happen soon. 

Feel free to poke around, just have mercy on me! haha
